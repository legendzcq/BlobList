**frame**  

In Core Audio, a set of samples that contains one sample from each channel in an audio data stream. In the most common case, the samples in a frame are time-coincidentâ€”that is, sampled at the same moment. For example, in a stereo stream each frame contains one sample from the left channel and a time-coincident sample from the right channel. More generally, the various channels in a stream, and therefore in a frame, may be from unrelated sources and may have originated at unrelated times. In video, a single image in a series that constitutes a movie.

**packet**  

In Core Audio, an encoding-defined unit of audio data comprising one or more frames. For PCM audio, each packet corresponds to one frame. For compressed audio, each packet corresponds to an encoding-defined number of uncompressed frames. For example, one packet of MPEG-2 AAC data decompresses to 1,024 frames of PCM data. In information technology, a packet is a block of data formatted for delivery over a network.

The number of frames requested and processed during one rendering cycle of an [audio unit](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CoreAudioGlossary/Glossary/core_audio_glossary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004453-CH210-SW12).

**sample**  

\1. (noun) An instantaneous amplitude of the signal in a single audio channel, represented as an integer, floating-point, or fixed-point number. 2. (verb) To collect samples from an audio source, typically an analog audio source. Sampling typically involves collecting samples at regular, very brief intervals such as 1/44,100 seconds. 3. (noun) An excerpt of a longer recording. When the excerpt is intended to be played repeatedly, it is called a [loop](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CoreAudioGlossary/Glossary/core_audio_glossary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004453-CH210-CHDJJDCF). 4. (verb) To record a sample to use as a loop or for inclusion in a another recording.

**sample rate** 

During playback, the number of samples played per second for each channel of an audio file. During recording, the number of samples acquired per second for each channel. Also called *sampling rate*. More properly, but less commonly, called *sampling frequency*.
